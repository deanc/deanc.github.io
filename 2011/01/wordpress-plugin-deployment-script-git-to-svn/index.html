				<p><strong>Short Version:</strong> This script will allow you to manage your wordpress plugins in git, and deploy them to wordpress.org SVN.</p>
<p><strong>Long Version:</strong></p>
<p>Recently at work I was required to build a wordpress plugin. After trawling through the documentation to figure out what I needed to do, it became apparent that to get my plugin listed in the WordPress plugins directory I would be required to host the code in their SVN repository. Along with most developers nowadays, I&rsquo;ve switched to Git (for numerous reasons), so I was left with the dilemna of how to manage my plugin within git and host it on Github, but sync all changes to the SVN repository whenever a new version was ready. There&rsquo;s quite a lot of work involved when trying to do this so I wanted to automate the whole thing. The result is a bash script shown below which will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check that the version numbers in your readme.txt match up with those in your PHP file.</li>
<li>Commit the latest outstanding changes to your git repository if any are left</li>
<li>Push the latest changes to github</li>
<li>Export the contents at the HEAD of your &lsquo;master&rsquo; branch in git to the trunk of your SVN repository.</li>
<li>Commit the changes to SVN and therefore push them  back to wordpress.org</li>
<li>Create an SVN tag for wordpress.org to use and commit it (this will be the same value as Stable Tag: <tagnumber> in your readme.txt)</li>
<li>Update the version number for future reference.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully this should make life a little easier for those WordPress plugin developers who wish to manage their projects in GIT :)</p>
