We created a predictive keyboard app which adjusts the language you use to talk about girls. For this project I developed the website for the campaign (not the app).</p><p>Technologies used:

In order to do this we hooked an escalator into the same back-end system created for the original machine conversations in order to allow the escalator to tweet.
We also filmed using 360 cameras an escalator ride, in order to embed a VR simulation of riding an escalator to the website.</p><p>Technologies used:

This was a huge undertaking involving close liason with KONE&rsquo;s R&amp;D team.</p><p>Messages are forwarded from IBM Bluemix to a listening service which stores all messages and adds them into an Amazon SQS queue. A series of worker processes then consume queue items and convert them into text conversations and their respective audio. The website then consumes these messages from an API and displays them.</p><p>An interesting part of this process is how to go from raw data into chat messages. Messages are represented as a JSON object featuring all kinds of sensor data including what is happening to the elevator (moving floors, doors opening/closing etc.) and then things such as the speed of the elevator and the vibration. This JSON is decoded and then fed into Symfony&rsquo;s expression language. This allows content editors to generate chat messages based on what is actually happening in the message. For example an expression might look like so: <code>elevator.stop_floor >= 0 and elevator.duration >= 5 and elevator.duration &lt;= 35</code> and the corresponding chat message might be: <code>Arrived on floor elevator.stop_floor. Travel took elevator.duration seconds.</code> This allows us to generate an unlimited amount of variation of content for the chat.</p></p><p>Technologies used:

If the moderator determined the complaint was interesting, they were able to remotely print a free cruise voucher using an internet-connected receipt printer.</p><p>We also created a banner which was featured on the front-page of many of Finland’s most popular websites, allowing people to complaint about their day - and be emailed a free cruise by moderators if the complaint was interesting. The banner served millions of views over the course of 5 days.</p></p><p>Technologies used:
