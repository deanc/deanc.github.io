	<meta name="description" content="Edit: This article is a little out-dated now, as Bootstrap is on version 3 featuring a completely different and fluid grid. It&rsquo;s still applicable if you are working with the older Bootstrap (up to version 2.3.2)

One of the challenges I have faced when doing my front-end work is trying to communicate to designers who have not done too much responsive work with Bootstrap, how the grid works. It&rsquo;s not as simple as telling someone to make a 968px wide layout anymore. One has to consider differing breakpoints. One of the interesting things about Twitter bootstrap is that in its [scaffolding guide][1] it talks about breakpoints at 1200px and 980px but you don&rsquo;t actually have that much width to work with. There is always a margin applied to the left of the layout resulting in only 1170px of available space on a 1200px grid.

				<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This article is a little out-dated now, as Bootstrap is on version 3 featuring a completely different and fluid grid. It&rsquo;s still applicable if you are working with the older Bootstrap (up to version 2.3.2)</p>

<p>One of the challenges I have faced when doing my front-end work is trying to communicate to designers who have not done too much responsive work with Bootstrap, how the grid works. It&rsquo;s not as simple as telling someone to make a 968px wide layout anymore. One has to consider differing breakpoints. One of the interesting things about Twitter bootstrap is that in its <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#responsive">scaffolding guide</a> it talks about breakpoints at 1200px and 980px but you don&rsquo;t actually have that much width to work with. There is always a margin applied to the left of the layout resulting in only 1170px of available space on a 1200px grid.</p>

<p>Furthermore, one has to then consider the margins in between the columns on the grid. Rather than leave this to interpretation I created this PSD template. You can just rip out the layers from it and put it on top of your existing design, or use it as a starting point to any of your designs which will utilise Bootstrap. It overlays a translucent grid for the top 3 bootstrap breakpoints: 1200px, 980px and 768px.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.deanclatworthy.com/2013/01/a-photoshop-psd-template-for-twitter-bootstraps-responsive-grid/bootstrap-guide/" rel="attachment wp-att-288"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-288" alt="Bootstrap-Guide" src="//deanclatworthy.com/assets/img/uploads/2013/01/Bootstrap-Guide-1024x682.png" width="625" height="416" /></a></p>

<p>You can utilise any of the space in green, but do not place anything on the leftmost or rightmost red areas.</p>

<p><em>I should, at this point, also stress that if you can/want to use the fluid layout of Bootstrap then this template will obviously be of no use to you.</em></p>
