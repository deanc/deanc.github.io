      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blog/1364-downtime-last-saturday&#34;&gt;recent github outages&lt;/a&gt; have highlighted is that although git is designed to be decentralized version control system, many people are not treating it that way. Rather than having multiple remotes, people push to the same place and generally rely too much on github. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people build their whole infrastructure around github, including deploy scripts for their sites and install scripts for new developers. Furthermore, dependency managers such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://getcomposer.org/&#34;&gt;Composer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://cocoapods.org/&#34;&gt;Cocoapods&lt;/a&gt; (not intending to single anyone out)Â rely on github to pull in dependencies. If github goes down, you can&amp;rsquo;t fix your dependencies or pull in new ones. In an ideal world these dependency managers should have built in support for mirrors, but I&amp;rsquo;m not aware of any such feature at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
