      <description>Last week I deployed a new Facebook application into a production environment. Everything seemed to be working perfectly, but then I received a report that the application wasn&amp;rsquo;t working correctly in IE8+. I narrowed down the problem, and then realised that sessions weren&amp;rsquo;t working. It turns out IE8+ has a security policy that prevents iframes from setting cookies if the parent domain is different. Therefore because my PHP session cooking wouldn&amp;rsquo;t set, the sessions obviously didn&amp;rsquo;t work between pages.</description>
