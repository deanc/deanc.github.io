      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week Facebook &lt;a href=&#34;http://newsroom.fb.com/News/600/Adding-What-You-re-Doing-to-Status-Updates&#34;&gt;rolled out a new update&lt;/a&gt;Â that lets people tag what they&amp;rsquo;re doing in their post or say how they are feeling. Users can say they are watching a movie or reading a book &amp;#8211; amongst other things. What makes this different from before is that your status update is providing more structured data to Facebook about your activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Last week I deployed a new Facebook application into a production environment. Everything seemed to be working perfectly, but then I received a report that the application wasn&amp;rsquo;t working correctly in IE8+. I narrowed down the problem, and then realised that sessions weren&amp;rsquo;t working. It turns out IE8+ has a security policy that prevents iframes from setting cookies if the parent domain is different. Therefore because my PHP session cooking wouldn&amp;rsquo;t set, the sessions obviously didn&amp;rsquo;t work between pages.</description>
