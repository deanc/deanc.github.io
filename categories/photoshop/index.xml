      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; This article is a little out-dated now, as Bootstrap is on version 3 featuring a completely different and fluid grid. It&amp;rsquo;s still applicable if you are working with the older Bootstrap (up to version 2.3.2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges I have faced when doing my front-end work is trying to communicate to designers who have not done too much responsive work with Bootstrap, how the grid works. It&amp;rsquo;s not as simple as telling someone to make a 968px wide layout anymore. One has to consider differing breakpoints. One of the interesting things about Twitter bootstrap is that in its &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#responsive&#34;&gt;scaffolding guide&lt;/a&gt;Â it talks about breakpoints at 1200px and 980px but you don&amp;rsquo;t actually have that much width to work with. There is always a margin applied to the left of the layout resulting in only 1170px of available space on a 1200px grid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
