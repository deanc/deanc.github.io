The folks over at Analog have created a nifty little tool called Hashgrid to overlay a grid over your web page like so:

Installation is pretty simple but I ran into a couple of minor issues which hopefully can be remedied in a future version:

The negative margin in the example is half the width of your grid, and whilst that&rsquo;s probably obvious it may be worth adding a comment in the CSS on hashgrid.com just to make that clear
I had to add a high z-index to the #grid in the CSS to make sure it correctly overlayed my page. If your grid isn&rsquo;t showing this is probably why.

The hardest part is creating the grid image in photoshop. The quickest way I found to do this is with the selection tool and guides. Once you&rsquo;ve created your guides it takes a few seconds to use the line tool to draw over your guides. If I get some time I might create a quick tool to generate dynamic grid images unless the hashgrid folks want to beat me to it ;-)"><meta property="og:description" content="Just a heads up to anyone who&rsquo;s planning on designing their next project using a grid.
